						<h2>A Need for Accurate Bruise Aging</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 22px">
							Every year, there are over 10 million domestic violence (DV) victims in the US alone.
							One of the most common injuries seen in DV cases are bruises: 
							injuries caused by impacts that does not tear the skin but still break blood vessels within it. 
							Being able to deduce the severity of a bruise and when the injury occurred can provide invaluable information for incident timelines and cross examinations.
                  			<br><br>
							The current method of aging bruises compares a victim’s bruise to a catalog of well documented and aged bruises, known as a coloration guide. 
							However, simply using the outward appearance is nowhere near accurate enough to be acceptable in a court setting - 
							studies find clinicians have an average success rate in the range of 55%-63%, making it is hardly better than a coin toss. 
							This inaccuracy is exacerbated for patients with darker skin tones; coloration guides are only representative of patients with lighter skin tones, 
							despite victims of color making up a staggering 40% of DV cases.
							Failing to accurately determine a bruise’s age could potentially lead to delayed or improper treatment for the victim and the obstruction of justice for the offender.
							<br><br>
							DermaVision Technologies aims to provide forensic and medical professionals with an accurate, portable, and non-invasive device capable of quantitatively measuring the age of a bruise,
							with a focus on overcoming racial disparities by ensuring effectiveness regardless of skin tone.

						<h2>The Technology Behind Our Solution</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 22px">
							Our device utilizes multispectral imaging, where imaging data is collected across a wider range 
							of light bands than just the typical red, green, and blue. By using light sources at specific wavelengths, 
							light-reflecting molecules called chromophores can be identified by their unique fluorescence response. 
							Different chromophores are present at different stages of a bruise's healing cycle, meaning analyzing their concentrations 
							can effectively age a bruise even days after initial injury. These results are independent of skin tone and will 
							be accurate for any patient.

							Our end goal is to create a device capable of fitting to a smartphone for portability and convenience, allowing forensic and medical 
							professionals to always be prepared to analyze a bruise for evidence or treatment purposes. Our current IRB-approved 
							prototype device is already prepared to begin building a robust bruise imaging dataset that will power the miniaturized 
							and portable version, bringing us ever closer to revolutionizing the practice of hematology in justice and medicine.
